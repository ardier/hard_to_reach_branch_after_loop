# Hard to Reach Branch After Loop

This project demonstrates a logic where a hard-to-reach branch occurs after a loop. It includes core logic as well as a fuzzing harness.

## Features

- **Core Logic**: Encapsulated in `src/example.cpp` and `src/example.hpp`.
- **Static Library**: Buildable via the included `Makefile`.
- **Test Binary**: `test_example` for manual testing.

## Build Instructions

1. **Build All Targets**:
   ```bash
   make
